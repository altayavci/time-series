## Forecasting confirmed covid-19 cases with Prophet Model by Facebook !

### Brief :
Time series analysis study on estimating confirmed covid-19 cases after 30 days by applying the Prophet Model with confirmed covid-19 cases published by countries.

### Prepare the Data, Build Model and See the Results :  
I processed the csv data I had and made it suitable for the Prophet model. While creating the model, I took care not to have NaN or null data because I did time series analysis. After running the model, I visualized the results and put them in the cross-validation phase. You can see the results on the notebook.
